      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used Yahoo Maps for as long as I can remember. Without it I would have had trouble getting places. Today, annoyed that my search criteria has not been remember the last few times I&amp;#8217;ve searched for it, I decided to go edit my locations and add the new one. I then noticed that Yahoo has decided to limit the number of saved locations to 10, for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that I didn&amp;#8217;t want to have to copy over the collection of saved locations I&amp;#8217;ve built up has kept me from switching away from Yahoo Maps, but now I will switch to Google Maps. I will no longer have to endure Yahoo&amp;#8217;s new obnoxious, slow Flash interface which it keeps forcing on me, and can now enjoy Google&amp;#8217;s new quick AJAX interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks Yahoo, Good Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
