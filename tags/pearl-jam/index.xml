      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pearl Jam&amp;#8217;s new album is officially released, Tuesday May 2nd. I received my pre-ordered copy Friday. Thanks, Ten Club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a really good album. Upon first listen I thought Riot Act was a much better ablum, and wasn&amp;#8217;t sure why this one was so over-hyped. Riot Act IS a great ablum, which doesn&amp;#8217;t get the respect it deserves, but this self-titled album is really good too. It is growing on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#8217;t sure about &amp;#8220;Marker in the Sand&amp;#8221; at first, but now I think it&amp;#8217;s my favorite song on the album. &amp;#8220;Come Back&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Gone&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;Inside Job&amp;#8221; are all great songs. &amp;#8220;Life Wasted&amp;#8221; is my favorite of the heavier rock stuff, and the reprise is cool too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially I thought the album kinda lulled in the middle, but &amp;#8220;Marker In The Sand&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Unemployable&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Gone&amp;#8221; are all great. &amp;#8220;Big Wave&amp;#8221; is my least favorite song on this release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m still not sure what&amp;#8217;s with all the hype, about this being their &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/_/id/9964953/rid/10028282/&#34;&gt;best album in ten years&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, or &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ETQRCM/ref=ase_matthewkeelan-20/102-2969308-2354536?s=music&amp;amp;v=glance&amp;amp;n=5174&amp;amp;tagActionCode=matthewkeelan-20&#34; title=&#34;eminence - A position of great distinction or superiority&#34;&gt;return to eminence&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; (This guy also says it&amp;#8217;s their first studio release since 2000, so he doesn&amp;#8217;t even count Riot Act). To me it sounds pretty much like Pearl Jam has since Matt Cameron joined (although &amp;#8216;Binaural&amp;#8217; sounded much better live than in album form, to me at least). It&amp;#8217;s not amazingly better than &amp;#8216;Riot Act&amp;#8217;, not at all, and it doesn&amp;#8217;t sound like Vs. or Ten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all it&amp;#8217;s a good album, from a band that has continuously put out good albums. I can&amp;#8217;t wait to see them perform these songs live in a couple weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
